# Specify organism here after you have created the respective folder in the digger data folder so that we can
# actually extend the graphs with the predicted data
organism: Mus musculus[mouse]
functions:
  - all # to run all functions
  - clean # clean the input sources to work with ppidm
  - map # map the sources to uniprot ids
  - predict # predict the interactions using ppidm
  - cumulate # cumulate the ddis with ppis to be able to extend the graph
  - extend # extend the graph with the cumulated ddis
params:
  - ignore_threshold: false  # to ignore the threshold for bad F1 scores
  - redo_similarities: true # to redo the similarity calculations
  - backup_domain_g: true   # to backup the domain graph
  # sets the number of parameters tested for the threshold generation, while it can have an impact, it is usually
  # very small and therefore not recommended to use this parameter
  # - iterations: 10_000
  # the coefficients to be used for the threshold generation. Must be a tuple of integers with length # of sources
  # if you are not 100% sure, do not use this parameter
  # - coefficients: (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
